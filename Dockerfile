#Dockerfile for a FastAPI application
# This Dockerfile sets up a FastAPI application using Uvicorn as the ASGI server
# Docker is a way of containerizing applications to run consistently across different environments (linux servers, local machines, etc.)
# It uses a slim version of Python 3.10 as the base image to keep the image size small
#Its like a virtual machine\environment but for the whole application
FROM python:3.10-slim
